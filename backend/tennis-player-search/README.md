# Tennis Player Search

This project is a web application that allows users to search for tennis players and view their rankings and statistics. The layout and design are inspired by the ATP rankings page on Flashscore.co, providing a user-friendly interface for tennis enthusiasts.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `src/index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the tennis player search page. It includes a search form, a section to display player results, and links to relevant resources.
  
- `src/styles/main.css`: The CSS file that styles the tennis player search page. It defines the visual appearance, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsive design elements to ensure compatibility across different devices.
